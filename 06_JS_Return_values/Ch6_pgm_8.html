/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Create a showPlayerInfo function with three
 *    parameters, playerName, playerHealth and
 *    playerPlace.
 *
 * 2) Call getPlayerHealth and getPlayerPlace
 *    from your new showPlayerInfo function.
 *
 *    e.g. showPlayerInfo("Dax", 50, "The Bath")
 *    should produce the output
 *
 *    Dax has health 50
 *    Dax is in The Bath
