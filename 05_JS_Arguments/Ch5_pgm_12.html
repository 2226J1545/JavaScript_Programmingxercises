/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) In the console.log parentheses, change
 *    playerName to playerName.substring(0, 1)
 *    Run the program. What do you think
 *    the substring function does?
 *
 * 2) Change the arguments to the substring
 *    function to (0, 2), then (0, 3) and so on.
 *
 * 3) Change the arguments to
 *    (1, 2), then (1, 3) and so on.
 *
 * 4) What role do you think the two arguments
 *    to the substring function have?
