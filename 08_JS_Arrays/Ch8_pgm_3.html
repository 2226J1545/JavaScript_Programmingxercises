/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Add a fifth score to the array.
 *
 * 2) Add an extra console.log to display the new score.
 *
 * The index of the last element is one less than
 * the length of the array.
 *
 * 3) Log the value of the last element to the console.
 *    Start the message with "The last score is " and
 *    concatenate the score to the string.
 *    Use an expression involving scores.length
 *    as the index for the last element.
 *
 * 4) Add an extra score to the array and 
 *    run the program again.
